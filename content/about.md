Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Akshaya Krishnan, a first-year student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham persuing BTech in Computer Science Engineering(AI). I'm a passionate developer with a curiosity for learning new things.


## Journey into Development

I got into development after starting my college journey. I was introduced to amFOSS, a student run club that helps you learn and experience firsthand - how to contribute code, interact with open source communities and participate in open source student programs. The club helped and guided me in learning new things and doing various projects.

## Interests and Hobbies

I enjoy readingðŸ“š, listening to musicðŸŽ¶ and watching seriesðŸ“º.

## Goals

As a student, I strive to learn new ways of creating applications that *positively impacts people's lives*. I am drawn to projects that challenge me and encourage me to think outside the box. Moreover, I believe in the power of teamwork and collaboration and look forward to working with like-minded individuals to create innovative solutions. I want to keep learning and improving.




Let's learn and grow together! ðŸŒ±
